## Misc

This project is developed solely by myself as a final project for Harvard University's <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/">CS50x Introduction to Computer Science Course</a>. I have no commercial or monetary purposes. This is developed only for educational purposes.

> I have to say this was, is, and will always be CS50 - the best course I've ever taken.

Special thanks to Harvard University, Prof. David J. Malan, and the staff!
