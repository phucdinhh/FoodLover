#### Description:
This project is developed as final project for Harvard University's CS50x Introduction to Computer Science Course, in November 2023.

The FoodLover website is designed to cater to enthusiasts who revel in the joy of culinary exploration. It facilitates users in searching for delectable recipes while offering the convenience of saving their favorites for future reference.

Main idea of the project is inspired from [Hany's CS50 Final Project: Recifilter](https://youtu.be/pKWqBQl-LmM) - a tutorial video that served as a wellspring of inspiration as I navigated through the conceptualization phase before embarking on the final project.
